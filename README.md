This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

### Pomodoro Timer

The app includes a Pomodoro Timer feature that helps you improve productivity using the Pomodoro Technique:

- **25-minute work intervals** followed by 5-minute breaks
- **Longer breaks** (15 minutes) after 4 cycles
- **Track Pomodoro sessions** tied to specific todos, habits, or workouts
- Simple and intuitive interface for timing work sessions

To use the Pomodoro Timer, navigate to `/pomodoro` in the application.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
